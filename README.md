Simple HTML5 landing page about Office 365 from Microsoft and Softline.
Built using jQuery (togglying classes, smooth scrolling for anchor menu, and openning hamburger menu), flexbox layout mode, but with a bit of media queries (for responsivenes), and some CSS3 animations.
This is the first HTML/CSS layout that I'm not ashemed to show so, don't judge strictly.)
Thanks for the attention.
